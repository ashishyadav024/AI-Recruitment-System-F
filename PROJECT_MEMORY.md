# AI Recruitment + AI Interview Project Memory

## 1. Main Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to transform this cloned repository into a functional, professional, and presentation-ready AI Recruitment + AI Interview web application within an aggressive 2-day delivery window.

We are utilizing this existing repository as our foundation because it already contains substantial implementations for resume analysis, LangGraph-based AI interview orchestration, Groq LLM integration, speech processing agents, and dashboard analytics. Rather than rebuilding from scratch, our objective is to stabilize, connect, and streamline existing functional components into a seamless, reliable end-to-end recruitment flow.

---

## 2. Final Product Flow

The target end-to-end product workflow consists of:

Resume Upload  
→ Resume Analysis  
→ Job / Role Selection  
→ Candidate Screening  
→ Shortlisting  
→ AI Interview  
→ AI Voice Interaction  
→ Adaptive Questions  
→ Answer Evaluation  
→ Final Interview Result  
→ Recruiter Dashboard  

---

## 3. Two-Day MVP Goal

For a rock-solid, working 2-day live demonstration, the core MVP must execute the following without manual intervention or crashes:

1. **Resume Ingestion & Parsing**: Recruiter uploads candidate resume(s) (PDF) and defines or selects a Job Description.
2. **Automated Screening & Ranking**: The system parses the resumes, matches candidate qualifications against job requirements, computes similarity/suitability scores, and displays a ranked candidate list with threshold filtering.
3. **Candidate Shortlisting**: Recruiter shortlists qualified candidates with a single action to initiate their interview.
4. **Browser-Based AI Interview Room**: Candidate enters a dedicated interview room featuring:
   - Live camera video feed (browser webcam)
   - Real-time AI interviewer questions displayed on screen
   - Voice interaction via Text-To-Speech (AI asks questions audibly)
   - Candidate voice capture via microphone with Speech-To-Text transcription
5. **Adaptive Questioning & Real-time Evaluation**:
   - The AI asks targeted technical and behavioral questions generated from the resume and job description.
   - The AI evaluates candidate responses in real-time.
   - If an answer is incomplete or vague, the AI asks an adaptive follow-up question.
6. **Final Result & Scorecard**:
   - Comprehensive post-interview report containing overall score (0-100), sub-scores (technical, communication, problem-solving), key strengths, areas of improvement, and hire/reject recommendation.
7. **Recruiter Dashboard**:
   - Central view displaying screened candidates, completed interviews, scores, transcripts, and evaluation reports.

---

## 4. Features We Can Reuse

The repository contains several rich, working modules that we can directly reuse:

1. **Resume Analysis & Match Engine (`backend/app.py` & `backend/main.py`)**:
   - PDF extraction via `PyPDF2` and spaCy.
   - Keyword, skill extraction, and TF-IDF / cosine similarity matching against Job Descriptions.
   - Groq LLM resume analysis agent (`backend/langgraph_agents/resume_analysis_agent.py`) for qualitative feedback.
2. **Interactive Screening UI (`src/components/ui/resumeAnalyzer.tsx`)**:
   - Batch resume upload, threshold filtering slider, candidate list display with match percentages, acceptance/rejection email generation, and CSV export.
3. **AI Interview Conductor (`backend/langgraph_agents/interview_conductor_agent.py`)**:
   - LangGraph StateGraph agent for running structured interviews.
   - Multi-stage interview flow (Intro → Technical → Behavioral → Situational → Closing).
   - Question generation tailored to candidate resume and job requirements using Groq (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`).
   - Real-time answer evaluation, scoring (0-10 scale), and adaptive follow-up question generation.
4. **Speech-to-Text Processing (`backend/langgraph_agents/audio_transcription_agent.py` & `/api/stt/transcribe`)**:
   - Groq Whisper (`whisper-large-v3`) audio transcription handling WAV/MP3/WebM audio files and base64 audio chunks.
5. **Text-to-Speech Generation (`backend/langgraph_agents/tts_agent.py` & `/api/tts/speak`)**:
   - Deepgram Aura / ElevenLabs TTS generation returning audible speech.
   - Can also fall back to browser-native Web Speech API (`window.speechSynthesis`) in the frontend for instantaneous zero-latency voice.
6. **Analytics & Scoring Engine (`backend/langgraph_agents/analytics_agent.py` & `backend/dashboard_service.py`)**:
   - Computation of multi-dimensional scores, latency, quality scores, strengths, and weaknesses.
   - JSON report endpoint (`/api/analytics/report/{session_id}`).
7. **Database Schemas & Repositories (`backend/db/` & `backend/repositories/`)**:
   - Standardized MongoDB schemas for users, resumes, job descriptions, interviews, and interview results.
8. **UI Component Library (`src/components/ui/`)**:
   - Radix UI + Tailwind CSS components (Card, Button, Dialog, Slider, Table, Badge, ScrollArea, Toaster).

---

## 5. Features We Need To Build or Fix

1. **API Port / Host Alignment**:
   - The frontend currently makes calls to `http://localhost:5000` (the Flask server), whereas the advanced interview orchestrator, STT, and WebSocket services reside on `http://localhost:8001` (the FastAPI server in `backend/main.py`).
   - Need to standardize frontend API configuration (`src/config/api.ts`) to point to a single unified backend endpoint or configure a reverse proxy.
2. **In-Browser AI Interview Room UI**:
   - The existing route `/interview/:roomid` points to `VideoInterview.tsx`, which loads an external ZegoCloud 1-on-1 video call room with hardcoded test tokens and ngrok links, completely disconnected from the AI interviewer backend.
   - Need to build/fix an interactive AI Interview Room page that connects webcam/mic, communicates with `/api/interview/start` and `/api/interview/answer`, plays AI audio, records candidate responses, and displays real-time subtitles/questions.
3. **Audio Streaming / Web Speech Pipeline**:
   - Ensure clean capture of microphone audio from the candidate and seamless handover to the transcription service (Groq Whisper or browser Web Speech API), then forwarding to the answer processing endpoint.
4. **Recruiter Evaluation / Results Page**:
   - Create a clean frontend view for recruiters to inspect completed interview results, review scores, read candidate answer transcripts, and see the AI recommendation.
5. **Configuration & Environment Setup**:
   - Create `.env` from `.env.template` with required keys (Groq API Key, MongoDB URI).

---

## 6. Features We Are Not Prioritizing

To ensure completion within the 2-day timeline, the following high-complexity, low-reliability features are deferred and will **not** block the MVP:

1. **Autonomous Google Meet Puppeteer/Playwright Bot (`meet_bot_joiner.py`, `meet_bot_launcher.py`)**:
   - Automated joining of Google Meet meetings requires dedicated Google bot credentials, session cookie management, bypassing Google bot detection/captchas, and virtual audio routing (VB-Cable/BlackHole).
   - *Alternative for MVP*: Direct, professional in-browser AI interview room. This is 100% reliable, runs on standard web technologies, and delivers an identical user experience without external meeting platform dependencies.
2. **Google Calendar OAuth Scheduling (`google_calendar_service.py`)**:
   - Google Calendar token refresh and OAuth verification adds unnecessary friction for a demo.
   - *Alternative for MVP*: Instant interview launch button upon candidate shortlisting.
3. **Distributed Multi-Worker Scaling (`distributed_orchestrator_agent.py`, `start_4_workers.ps1`)**:
   - Redis/distributed worker orchestration for thousands of concurrent interviews is unnecessary for demonstration purposes. Single server process is sufficient.
4. **Firebase Auth User Role Synchronization**:
   - Authentication can either use existing simple credentials or bypass directly to the recruiter workflow for demo speed.

## 14. Video Interview Phase

---

### Task 1: Webcam Integration — COMPLETE

- **Status**: COMPLETE & VERIFIED
- **File changed**: `src/components1/VideoInterview.tsx` only
- **Implementation**: Native browser `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: false })`
- **Display**: `<video ref autoPlay playsInline muted>` with `srcObject` binding
- **Camera states implemented**:
  - `idle` — brief initial state before camera auto-starts
  - `requesting` — spinner shown while awaiting browser permission
  - `active` — live video stream visible with green dot + red LIVE badge
  - `denied` — `NotAllowedError` caught, amber warning shown to candidate
  - `unavailable` — `NotFoundError` / unsupported browser caught, grey placeholder shown
  - `off` — manually turned off, placeholder + "Turn camera back on" link shown
- **Camera auto-starts** when interview begins (`useEffect` on `interviewStarted`)
- **Camera on/off controls**: "Turn Off Camera" / "Turn On Camera" toggle button in camera panel header
- **Stream cleanup on unmount**: `useEffect` cleanup stops all `MediaStream` tracks — camera LED turns off when leaving the page
- **No external libraries, no streaming service, no backend changes, no new dependencies**
- **Existing AI interview functionality**: Typed answers, Web Speech API voice answers, adaptive questions, final scorecard — all unchanged and verified
- **`npx tsc --noEmit`**: PASS (0 errors)
- **`npm run build`**: PASS (8.77s)
- **Browser verification**: Camera permission prompt → live video → toggle off → toggle on → navigate away stops camera → no console errors

---

### Task 2: AI TTS — COMPLETE

- **Status**: COMPLETE & VERIFIED
- **File changed**: `src/components1/VideoInterview.tsx` only
- **Implementation**: Browser-native `window.speechSynthesis` + `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` — zero dependencies, zero backend changes
- **Feature detection**: `'speechSynthesis' in window` — interview continues normally if unsupported (shows "Browser TTS unavailable" note)
- **Voice selection**: Prefers natural English voice (Google, Natural, Samantha, Daniel) → falls back to any `en` voice → falls back to browser default
- **TTS config**: `rate=0.95`, `pitch=1.0`, `lang='en-US'`
- **Auto-speak**: `useEffect` on `currentQuestion` (with 300ms delay to allow voice list to load) auto-speaks every new AI question
- **Stop Speaking**: `speechSynthesis.cancel()` — immediately stops current speech, transitions header to Replay state
- **Replay Question**: Cancels any current speech, re-speaks `currentQuestion` — restores "AI is speaking..." indicator
- **New question arrives**: Previous speech cancelled, new question spoken automatically
- **Unmount cleanup**: `useEffect` cleanup calls `speechSynthesis.cancel()` — no speech continues after leaving the interview
- **UI**: Speaking indicator (pulsing cyan dot + "AI is speaking...") + "Stop Speaking" button while active; "Replay Question" button when idle — in existing question card header
- **Autoplay note**: Browser autoplay policy may block auto-speech until first user interaction. "Replay Question" handles this — no crash, no interview block
- **Existing functionality unchanged**: Webcam, Web Speech API mic, typed answers, Groq evaluation, adaptive questions, final scorecard — all verified
- **`npx tsc --noEmit`**: PASS (0 errors)
- **`npm run build`**: PASS (8.00s)
- **Browser verification**: AI introduction auto-spoken → Stop Speaking cancels → Replay Question re-speaks → no console errors

---

### Video Interview Phase — Task 2A: Interview Room Visual Redesign

- **Status**: COMPLETE & VERIFIED
- **File changed**: `src/components1/VideoInterview.tsx` only
- **Two-panel video-call layout**: Two balanced video-call panels (desktop: side-by-side, mobile: stacked) resembling Google Meet / Zoom / Teams.
- **AI interviewer avatar panel**: Centered AI avatar with dark video-call background, "AI Interviewer" label, participant name tag pill, and audio visualizer.
- **Candidate webcam panel**: Live camera video stream rendered via `videoRef`, top-right `LIVE` badge, bottom-left participant name tag with real-time mic status, and bottom-right `#camera-toggle-btn`.
- **AI speaking visual driven by existing isSpeaking state**: Concentric multi-layer pulsing glow rings around avatar + dynamic 4-bar audio equalizer badge triggered when `isSpeaking` is true; static when idle.
- **Candidate camera on/off**: Camera can be toggled on and off cleanly via `#camera-toggle-btn` with tracks stopped on turn-off and unmount.
- **Camera-off placeholder**: Displays video-call style placeholder with candidate initials avatar circle, "Camera is turned off" text, and "Turn camera on" link.
- **Question displayed below video panels**: Current AI question presented prominently below the video grid in styled speech blockquote with stage badge.
- **Existing TTS controls preserved**: Automatic question reading, `#tts-stop-btn` ("Stop Speaking"), and `#tts-replay-btn` ("Replay Question") fully functional.
- **Existing microphone controls preserved**: `#speak-answer-btn`, `#listening-banner` ("Done Speaking"), real-time transcript insertion into `#candidate-answer-textarea`, and `#submit-answer-btn` fully functional.
- **Existing interview logic unchanged**: Groq questions, LangGraph conductor, answer evaluation, adaptive follow-ups, and scorecard unchanged.
- **TypeScript passed**: `npx tsc --noEmit` exited 0 with 0 errors.
- **Production build passed**: `npm run build` completed in 8.48s with exit code 0.
- **Browser verification passed**: Full verification at `http://localhost:3000/interview/TestCandidate` confirmed all visual components and interaction flows work.
- **0 console errors**: Browser console completely clean.

### NEXT TASK: Recruiter Dashboard & Final MVP Demo Preparation

*(To be defined and approved by the project lead.)*

*(DO NOT implement until reviewed and approved.)*

---

## 15. Development Rules

1. **Read PROJECT_MEMORY.md before every development task.**
2. **Do not break existing working functionality.**
3. **Do not modify unrelated files.**
4. **Do not implement future tasks without explicit instruction from the project lead.**
5. **Prefer the simplest working solution** to guarantee 2-day delivery.
6. **Avoid unnecessary dependencies.**
7. **Never store secrets, passwords, or API keys in PROJECT_MEMORY.md or version control.**
8. **Update PROJECT_MEMORY.md after every major completed task.**
9. **Never claim something works unless it has actually been tested and verified.**
10. **Keep the 2-day working demonstration as the supreme priority.**

| 2026-09-20 | Backend Environment Configuration & Verification | Inspected config files, prepared `backend/.env`, installed missing dependencies (`fastapi`, `pymongo`, `groq`, `langgraph`, `deepgram-sdk`), verified 83 routes in `main.py`, identified port 5000 vs 8001 dual-architecture. |
| 2026-09-20 | Task 3 Connection Troubleshooting | Detected initial empty `.env` on disk; user saved valid credentials. |
| 2026-09-20 | Task 3C DNS & Connectivity Diagnostics | Verified DNS SRV resolution, TCP port 27017 connection, and successful PyMongo Atlas ping. |
| 2026-09-20 | Task 4 Boot FastAPI & Smoke Test | FastAPI, MongoDB, /health, /docs all PASSED. Groq model 404 identified (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`), and missing initial MongoDB state persistence identified in `start_interview`. |
| 2026-09-20 | Task 5 Groq Model Configuration & Interview Persistence | Configured `GROQ_MODEL=qwen/qwen3.8-27b` in `.env` and `interview_conductor_agent.py`. Implemented initial interview state persistence in `start_interview` via `store_interview`. Verified `/health` (PASS), `/api/interview/start` with Groq-generated intro (PASS), MongoDB persistence (PASS), and `/api/interview/answer` with AI evaluation and next technical question generation (PASS). |
| 2026-09-20 | Task 6 Frontend AI Interview Room Integration | Replaced dead ZegoCloud ngrok code in `VideoInterview.tsx` with live interactive AI interview room connected to FastAPI port 8001. Added `FASTAPI_BASE_URL` in `api.ts` and created `interviewService.ts`. Fixed unconfigured Firebase and Groq SDK startup exceptions. Tested complete browser flow end-to-end: Start AI Interview → AI Introduction → Candidate Answer → AI Evaluation → Technical Question #1. Verified `tsc` (0 errors) and `npm run build` (PASS). |
| 2026-09-20 | Task 7 Candidate Screening to Interview Connection | Connected candidate screening in `src/components/ui/resumeAnalyzer.tsx` to `src/components1/VideoInterview.tsx`. Passed candidate name, email, target job title, parsed skills, and resume profile with zero invented values. Handled both individual card and batch "Start Interview" actions. Verified browser hand-off, form pre-population, and AI interview start (`tsc` 0 errors, build PASS, browser test PASS). |
| 2026-09-20 | Task 8 Voice Interaction in AI Interview Room | Added voice interaction layer to `src/components1/VideoInterview.tsx` using browser Web Speech API. Inspected FastAPI STT health (200 OK). Integrated "Speak Answer", live listening state, real-time speech insertion into answer textarea, full text editing capability, and error handling. Verified browser test end-to-end with multiple question evaluation cycles (`tsc` 0 errors, build PASS, browser test PASS). |
| 2026-09-20 | Task 9 Restore Flask Resume Analysis | Installed `spacy==3.8.16` and `en_core_web_sm==3.8.0`. Fixed two Flask startup issues: (1) `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows cp1252 — resolved via `PYTHONUTF8=1`; (2) Werkzeug watchdog reloader `WinError 10038` + env var loss — fixed by adding `use_reloader=False` to `app.run()`. Verified HTTP 200 with real PDF, score=44.0, Groq skills extraction working. |
| 2026-09-20 | Task 10 Fix Resume Analysis Groq Model Config | Replaced hardcoded `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` in `resume_analysis_agent.py` with `os.getenv('GROQ_MODEL', 'qwen/qwen3.8-27b')`. Verified `/api/analyze` with `Vaibhav_Narute.pdf` (score=58.0, 8 matching skills) and `Aaryan Gole - Resume.pdf` (score=28.0). Candidate handoff, `tsc` (0 errors), `npm run build` all PASS. |
| 2026-09-20 | MVP Checkpoint — Verified before Video Interview + AI TTS phase | 21/21 QA checks passed. Full end-to-end flow confirmed. Git checkpoint committed. |
| 2026-09-20 | Video Interview Phase Task 1 — Webcam Integration | Added native webcam preview to `VideoInterview.tsx` using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`. Implemented idle/requesting/active/off/denied/unavailable camera states, toggle on/off control, auto-start on interview begin, and stream cleanup on unmount. Zero backend changes, zero new dependencies. `tsc` (0 errors), `npm run build` (PASS 8.77s), browser verified (camera active, toggle works, no console errors). |
| 2026-09-20 | Video Interview Phase Task 2 — AI TTS | Added `window.speechSynthesis` TTS to `VideoInterview.tsx`. AI questions auto-spoken on arrival (300ms delay for voice list). Stop Speaking / Replay Question controls in question card header. Pulsing cyan "AI is speaking..." indicator. Unmount cleanup cancels speech. Feature-detected with graceful fallback. Autoplay policy handled via Replay button. Zero backend changes, zero new dependencies. `tsc` (0 errors), `npm run build` (PASS 8.00s). |
| 2026-09-20 | Video Interview Phase Task 2A — Interview Room Visual Redesign | Redesigned `VideoInterview.tsx` active room into a modern 2-panel video call interface (Zoom / Meet style). Left panel: AI Interviewer (camera-off participant, centered avatar with concentric pulsing ring animation + 4-bar audio equalizer driven by existing `isSpeaking`). Right panel: Candidate Webcam (live feed via `videoRef`, LIVE badge, name tag with mic state, camera toggle on/off, video-call placeholder when off). AI Question presented prominently below video panels with TTS controls. Candidate answer textarea and mic controls preserved with zero logic changes. Zero backend changes, zero new dependencies. `tsc` (0 errors), `npm run build` (PASS 8.48s), browser verified. |

NO ISSUES identified. Zero code fixes needed. `tsc` (0 errors), `npm run build` (PASS 7.97s), 0 console errors. |
| 2026-09-21 | Task 4C — Implement Stitch Dashboard UI | Applied Stitch design system from project `10427640464256011024` to create Recruiter Dashboard (`/dashboard` and `/recruiter-dashboard`). Implemented: 1. Fixed sidebar & navigation; 2. Header HUD with live engine status & search; 3. 4 KPI metric cards; 4. Active Job Roles trackers; 5. Stitch Resume Upload & Intake Funnel modal with 6 Intelligence Vectors & extraction telemetry; 6. Candidate Screening Table with role/status filters & sorting; 7. Stitch Interview Result & Performance Scorecard modal with circular score gauge; 8. 3-Column Bento Grid with Interview Activity SVG chart & AI hiring insights; 9. Candidate handoff flow to `VideoInterview.tsx`. LOCKED files (`VideoInterview.tsx`, `interviewService.ts`, `interview_conductor_agent.py`) untouched. `npx tsc --noEmit` (0 errors), `npm run build` (PASS 11.44s), browser verified end-to-end. |
| 2026-09-21 | Presentation Readiness Audit & Startup Automation | Completed full end-to-end frontend audit across 31 checklist points. Verified `npx tsc --noEmit` (0 errors) and `npm run build` (PASS 6.92s). Confirmed working status for Recruiter Workflow, Resume/JD analysis, AI voice interview room, and final scorecard. Implemented `start_demo.ps1` for one-command PowerShell startup of Flask (5000), FastAPI (8001), and Vite (3000). Updated `README.md` with presentation instructions. Documented remaining presentation limitation: dual-backend launch requirement. |
